        Hello World,
        <br />
        I am just a young developper with big dreams who loves watching sports.
        Tech Lover + Sport Lover = ? Why not a sports streaming site!
        <br />I will be trying to cover the maximum of games with the least of
        ads. Although ads are disgusting but at a certain point I will really
        need them to pursue paying the hosting costs. Thank you!
